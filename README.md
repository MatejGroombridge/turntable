# __DISPLAY_NAME__

Part of the personal Android app suite, distributed via
[Groom Hub](https://github.com/MatejGroombridge/personal-app-store-frontend).

## Build

Requires JDK 17, Android SDK 35.

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

For a signed release build, set up `keystore.properties` at the repo root:

```properties
storeFile=/path/to/release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=main
keyPassword=...
```

then `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`.

## Release

Cut a new version with the changeset helper:

```bash
./bin/changeset
```

It bumps `versionName` + `versionCode` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, prepends a
new entry to `CHANGELOG.md`, commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes — which
triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` to build, sign, attach the APK to a
GitHub Release, and patch the central manifest. Within ~3 minutes the Groom
Hub app on your phone offers the new version.

## AI Agent

This repo includes an [`agent.md`](agent.md) with a full reference for AI coding agents — covering architecture, conventions, build config, signing, the release workflow, and more.
